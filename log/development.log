A: I worked as an SAT prep tutor straight out of college.

Q: What was the best part of the job?
A: The hours were somewhat flexible - I taught night classes for a while which gave me all day to work on a book I was writing at the time.

Q: What was the worst part of the job?
A: Working with high schoolers can be frustrating.

Q: What did you learn while there?
A: If you are really passionate about something (in my case, writing a book), don''t try to split your time between two things. You end up losing interest in your hobby too quickly since there is less time for fun.

Q: What are you most proud of during your time there?
A: I brought a student with a learning disability up 360 points!

Q: What do you plan to do after you graduate? (posted by Adam)
